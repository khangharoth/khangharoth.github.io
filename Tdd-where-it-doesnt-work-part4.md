TDD Part 4 : Where TDD doesn't work


There are very few topics that divide the software practitioners like TDD.

**Argument** : 
On one hand, we have tdd champions like Uncle Bob who went on to compare practising TDD with practice of washing hands in the medical profession. Taking a quote from his article.

“If I am right… If TDD is as significant to software as hand-washing was to medicine and is instrumental in pulling us back from the brink of that looming catastrophe, then Kent Beck will be hailed a hero, and TDD will carry the full weight of professionalism. After that, those who refuse to practice TDD will be excused from the ranks of professional programmers. It would not surprise me if, one day, TDD had the force of law behind it.”

Other proponents like Kent back and Martin flower takes a centrist approach in favour of TDD.
The argument is that you need to prove that your code works and what’s better than to have something which is automated and reusable going forward. Also writing a test first means development efforts are targeted which helps the developer to remain focused. Having tests as the first client helps in coming up with the modular decoupled design.

**Counter Argument** :
On the other hand, some of the smartest brains in the industry have come out very openly against the said benefits of this promise.

DHH, creator of framework Ruby on rails, came out very strongly on this in his article 
TDD is dead. Long live testing, where he is cautioning against the growing cult of TDD practitioner
“Test-first fundamentalism is like abstinence-only sex ed: An unrealistic, ineffective morality campaign for self-loathing and shaming.”


Erik Meijer, in his talk One hacker way, went on to totally reject the whole premise.
“The only way you can create your software is to just put it in production! Because it will fail. And then, when it fails you just roll back to the previous version! … There’s no way you can pretend you can test your software beforehand. So all this TDD crap? Forget about it. If your company does TDD what do you do? Leave! You quit! You hand in your resignation today! … Writing tests is waste. TDD is for pussies.”




So how come the same practice has such a diverse reaction from some of the well-known names in our industry. 

Is one group wrong? Or is this of both groups right and difference comes from the difference in vantage point?

So what are the scenarios where TDD doesn’t really work and hence having a false expectation would do more harm than good?
