TDD Part 3 : TDD done right


Bridge the Gap: 

For the developers, who have seen the TDD working, swear by it, as it makes feedback very fast and precise and hence the dichotomy of experiences exists in the software community.

So what’s missing in the typical team set up when they embark on this journey? and what can be done to increase the odds of success for a new team?

TDD is a practise which takes time to learn and understand (1yrs +) and while the philosophy is the same the solutions to the problems faced by the team needs to be dealt with in a given context. It can’t be taught fully in a classroom session with 10’s of disparate code katas, as they are all disjointed . Code katas are useful but you can’t really learn about the day to day trade offs of the production system by katas.It's more akin to teaching participants, to draw a few circles and then asking them to complete the full owl. How to go about if that owl needs to face in another direction!





To bridge the gap between few tutorials and real life problems,the teams would have to look at 
Apprenticeship model which works so well for other industries like Carpentry,manufacturing etc.

The team needs to be formed with mentors and guides with a typical ratio of one guide per 2-3 junior developers. These mentors have seen TDD working in real life scenarios and have a good amount of experience (5+) to make TDD effective in various scenarios and set up and not really chasing for the ideal set up, where they saw it working one time.These are master practitioners who have seen the value of practise work in  real world in various projects and hence can understand the nuances very well.
